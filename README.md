> A practical variation of BlooP/FlooP, and an implementation of the recursion theorem.

This library/binary implements easy conversion of BlooP/FlooP programs between variious forms, executing them, and contains even a constructive proof(*) recursion theorem.

## Install

No idea FIXME

## Usage

Oh god FIXME

### Execution

FIXME

### Conversion between formats

### Recursion theorem prover

## Background

FIXME

### The base language: BlooP

FIXME

### Making it FlooP

FIXME

### Syntactic sugar

## Performance

Terrible.

## TODOs

* Everything!
* Tests!
* `pub`-correctness?
* Documentation!

## NOTDOs

Here are some things this project will definitely not support:
* General support for high-level languages

These are highly unlikely, but if you actually need them and can tell me
how to elegantly implement it, I might look into it:
* Incredibly good performance
* Compilation to native instructions
* binfmt wrapper so that arbitrary fles can be treated as a program
